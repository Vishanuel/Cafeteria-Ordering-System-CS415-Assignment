Ma'am, I have created the student interface for ordering from COS, which is quite similiar to the Patron interface. I just wanted to confirm, if the students would also be able to pay from their credit/debit card and would they be able to request for delivery?
Ma'am, you have mentioned in the project 1 feedback, that we would need to improve the User Interface for our web application, i just wanted to know if there are any specific thing that needs to be changed? 
Firstly, for feature 8 (Produce recipes and ingredients), do the customers select a written recipe from the database, or does the customer has the freedom to create or write their recipe, same goes for the ingredients and when the customers do select/write their ingredients...does the customer also specify the quantity of the ingredients or is that included in the recipe. And how will the price be determined? will the restaurant determine it after getting the order or something else entirely?
Furthermore, for feature 4 (Register for meal payment options - credit/ debit card payment) do we also create a separate dummy table in the database to mimic what happens in the credit card transaction, just like the payroll system?
